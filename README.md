Anagram Shark Attack JS-E
=========================
2019 Rob-on-earth

Take on the hungry Sharks in this simple watery themed anagram game.

[See various demos during the development process](https://robgithub.github.io/AnagramSharkAttackJS-E/)

Just drag and drop the letter tiles to spell an oceananic word.

This a remake of a [Silverlight]( http://www.slsushi.co.uk/) [game I created many years ago]( http://www.pay4foss.org/jumpstation/AnagramSharkAttack/)
